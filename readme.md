- [Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/)

Cewu Lu is a Research Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). Before he joined SJTU, he was a research fellow at Stanford University working under Prof. Fei-Fei Li and Prof. Leonidas J. Guibas. He was a Research Assistant Professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with Prof. Chi Keung Tang . He got the his PhD degree from The Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Jiaya Jia. He is one of core technique member in Stanford-Toyota autonomous car project (斯坦福-丰田，无人车项目). Some of his proposed algorithms have been used as a basic tool function in OpenCV(such as decolor.cpp). He has one Best Paper Award at the Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering (NPAR) 2012 and one most cited paper among all papers in SIGGRAPH recent 5 years .He serves as an associate editor for [Journal gtCVPR]and reviewer for Journal TPAMI and IJCV. His research interests fall mainly in Computer Vision, deep learning, deep reinforcement learning and robotics vision.

- [Flood Sung](https://github.com/floodsung)

Independent Researcher of AI. Focus on Deep Reinforcement Learning, Meta Learning, Robot Learning


- [Stephen James](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~slj12/)

I am a PhD student in the Dyson Robotics Lab at Imperial College London. My research involves developing solutions for robot manipulation tasks using state-of-the-art in deep learning and reinforcement learning. The goal involves teaching robots to understand the world around them and perform complex manipulation tasks that requires hand-eye coordination whilst interpreting all the relevant information from images alone. I am also a teaching assistant at Imperial College London, teaching operating systems, compilers, and software engineering design.
